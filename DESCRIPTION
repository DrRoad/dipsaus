Description: Works as `add-ons` to packages like 'shiny', 'future', as well as `rlang`,
    and provides handy utility functions. The enhancements are: 1. providing more 
    `shiny` input widgets and making small changes to its native inputs; 2. high-performance 
    computing using `RcppParallel` and `future` package; 3. easy ways to modify R calls 
    and convert among numbers, strings, and other objects. 4. utility functions 
    to get system information such like CPU chipset, memory limit, etc.
